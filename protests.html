                “One of the illuminating moments of my life occurred, amazingly enough, at a piano bar on the San Francisco peninsula. In the bar, a woman was playing, splendidly, familiar Cole Porter and Steven Sondheim tunes. A man sitting at the bar began a conversation with her and, shortly afterward, extracted a clarinet from a case. It was clear they had never met, but they were soon playing together. After a while, I realized they had not played the tune of anything specific. They knew the melodies; we knew the melodies. And so their effort could go toward making beautiful figures over the familiar material- it was transporting. I then suddenly saw a future for architecture. After a half-century full of brilliant, single buildings, and deteriorating towns full of macho erections that evoked the Chinese notion of yang, it was perhaps time for a half century of yin, of healing and joining the things we all share (like the Sondheim melodies) so that we might have a period of getting it together”
                <br>
                <br> -Charles Moore from “Water and Architecture”
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1957, Charles Moore submitted his doctoral thesis, Water and Architecture, to the school of architecture at Princeton University. His central claim in the paper was that when “whenever architects or designers include water in their compositions, they can plunge into a treasure chest of physical characteristics, legends, and allegories to enhance their designs.” This simple yet provocative idea made clear Moore’s raison d'etre. To Moore, architecture was meant to challenge the human condition through profound experiential connections. Be it the visual complexity of “sweeping cantilevers against uplifting stone towers” at Fallingwater or the experience of hearing two apparent strangers suddenly play familiar melodies at a Piano bar in San Francisco. Today, architectural theorists point to Water and Architecture as one of the foundational texts for what we refer to now as Phenomenology. Phenomenology is a topic in architecture that has been both profoundly over and under intellectualized. It’s definition, in actuality, is not that dissimilar to what Moore wrote so aptly about in 1957. Phenomenology, simply, is an overwhelming appeal to the senses that often lead to larger than life recognitions of one's own humanity. Designers and artists like Peter Zumthor, Steven Holl, James Turrel, and Olafur Elliason are often cited as the contemporary masters of the phenomenological. It’s precisely in this contemporary notion of phenomenology, however, that this paper will take onus with. The practice of architecture in our global economy has removed the inherent humanism from phenomenology. What was once a philosophy celebrating the collective experience of being human, is now little more than a buzzword to sell to museum directors. It’s in this context that one can’t help but think of Adolfo Natalini’s famous 1971 quote: 
                <br>
                <br>
“If design is merely an inducement to consume, then we must reject design; if architecture is merely the codifying of bourgeois model of ownership and society, then we must reject architecture; if architecture and town planning is merely the formalisation of present unjust social divisions, then we must reject town planning and its cities”
<br>
<br>
Indeed to practice any form of phenomenology, in its current conception, is to perpetuate and bolster a system that has routinely decimated the lives of minority communities in America. It’s in phenomenology, however, that I believe architects and designers have an avenue to reposition the future of the field. In this paper I’ll take a route similar to that of Moore in 1957. Instead of water, however, I believe it's through a thorough analysis of protests that we can begin to create a class-conscious approach to phenomenology that truly celebrates our collective humanity.
<br>
<br>
	To discuss the role of phenomenology and protests, it would be prudent to first discuss the relationship between protests and design. Much of this analysis stems from the work of Tali Hatuka’s book “The Design of Protest : Choreographing Political Demonstrations in Public Space”. Hatuka’s central argument starts simply as an acknowledgment that planning a protest demands serious labor and a myriad of design decisions. Early on in the book,Hatuka outlines three primary questions that must be answered for a protest to achieve its goal. First, “Choosing a place for the action.” Hatuka further complicates this by enumerating the things that must be considered when choosing a site. The presence of surveillance, for example, is something that needs to be fully explored, so the safety of the participants isn’t in jeopardy. Next, “Deciding on a method to communicate the protest.” Hatuka elaborates that using the appropriate spheres of influence is one of the most crucial aspects in ensuring the method is tightly linked to the target audience. And Finally, “Agreeing about the process of negotiating power and with whom.” Both prior to and after the protest, understanding the relationship between the protest and those in power is what gives the protest the ability to enact actual change. Hatuka outlines these decisions simply as the spatial, social, and political frameworks with which the rest of the protest can be created. Hatuka’s central argument is only bolstered when architectural modes of representation are applied to protests. In the below site drawings, for example, we can use architecture’s inherent obsession with scale to better analyze how people organize in protests.
<br>
<br>

Much of Hatuka’s writing is directly concerned with the relationship of bodies to one another and how that influences the form of protests. In large spaces people “tend to initiate megascale events in a focal location.” Houston’s George Floyd March was the perfect case study to understand this mode of development. Intense emotions and a variety of desires coalesced and found themselves centered focally on City Hall.
<br>
<br>

	For smaller protests, Hatuka wrote that “groups tend to support a dispersed configuration of events, with dissent occurring in multiple venues simultaneously.” These are the protests that many smaller towns and cities across the United States found themselves experiencing over the summer. Areas with less consolidated city centers or pronounced organizers found themselves overcome with emotion to the point of sometimes individual action.It's in this analysis that we can begin to understand how phenomenology starts to play a role in a more communal, humanistic architecture.
	Phenomenology, in the contemporary setting, is often considered only achievable in the quiet, solitary reflection of a well-versed patron. Yet over the summer, architecture was a central figure in expressing the intense emotions felt by large swaths of people. It’s precisely in these moments that I believe we can start to develop the foundations for a class conscious, communal approach to phenomenology.
    <br>
<br>

 Nowhere has this revitalized phenomenology been more perfectly encapsulated than in the burning of a Minneapolis police station following the murder of George Floyd. This pure, unadulterated display of emotion transformed the symbolic brutality of the police precinct into a vessel with which members of the Minneapolis community could appropriately express their inherent humanity. Likewise, in places like Richmond, Virginia, we saw a monument to Robert E. Lee transformed through the collective interventions of a community.
 <br>
 <br>

It’s in these communal interventions that architects should begin to revisit the term phenomenology. In fact, other designers have found great success in looking to community based interpretations of design terms. Tactical Urbanism is undoubtedly one of the best examples for this. Rather than look to large scale urban planning, Tactical Urbanism prompts “city, organizational, and/or citizen-led approach[es] to neighborhood building using short-term, low-cost, and scalable interventions to catalyze long-term change.” Indeed, there is no shortage of ways in which the field of architecture could benefit from a communal based approach to organizing.
<br>
<br>
	Just as Moore observed in 1957, we are in dire need of a period of healing. Yet since Water and Architecture, Architecture has only further sacrificed its community organizing ability in favor of neoliberal market successes. It's through this reframing of phenomenology that I thoroughly believe Architects could at least start to bridge the gap between architecture and the communities it claims to serve.
