                        In my design for a branch of the Houston public library, I created a library that was almost entirely fixated on the language of the facade. Drawing from the local vernacular of developer townhomes, this project reflects on the possibilities of a hyper-vernacular aesthetic that blends in yet entirely sticks out. <br>
                        The project is broken down simply into separate developer styles. These styles are defined by the flattening, commodified language often associated with these townhomes. Styles like “Modern”, “European”, “Rustic”, and “Spanish” carry with them distinct approaches, with varying degrees of separation from any source material.
                        The interior stands not in opposition to the exterior, rather it remains in constant dialogue. Patrons are invited to draw their own conclusions about the style and enjoy the oddity of it.
