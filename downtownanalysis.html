                                This project uses a mix of disciplinary and non-disciplinary tools to produce a critique of contemporary trends in public space development. By taking current political developments to their logical extremes, the project imagines the reality of a privately-owned public city. Reconciling with a world where working from home collapses the downtown real estate market, Houston is left scrambling to maintain the future of the city. To stay afloat, Houston pitches Amazon on a revolutionary new partnership where Amazon could radically develop the city as they saw fit, in return Houston would remain solvent and receive a huge investment into public infrastructure. <br> <br>
	This new model is rife with issues to critique. It imagines the reality of a labor workforce suffering under the insane efficiency parameters of a city-wide logistics project. It imagines a world that is totally subdivided between the world of work and play; played out in the relationship between the towers and the tunnels. It imagines the new, profound importance of the lobby as a transitory space. All in the hopes that we may better understand the dangers of private ownership models; particularly as tax bases continue to leave city centers.
