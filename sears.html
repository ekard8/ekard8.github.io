                Houston has often, and appropriately, been characterized as a city uninterested with the project of preservation. On November 15th, 2016, Barry Moore, senior associate at Gensler architects, argued that Houston’s preservation movement has finally “Turned the Corner”, but November 15th, 2016 was a vastly different time from where we are now. Houston’s relatively new mayor, Sylvester Turner, was still 2 years out from announcing his plan to turn Houston into an Innovation Center; Donald Trump had yet to take office; Houston’s economy was still shaking from the violent changes it had undergone in the past year, and Harvey was still a year away from wreaking havoc. The public’s ability to care for certain issues, like preservation, in the meantime has been stretched razer thin. This apathy, however, is precisely the conditions that Houston developers historically have looked for. In the chaos, the motives of developers can be read more clearly, but often circumvent the focus of public ire. Nowhere is this more evident than in the redevelopment of the historic Houston Sears building. In this paper I will argue that the Sears building, and its new life as The Ion, is the perfect case study for how space and aesthetics have been weaponized, by developers, against minority communities in Houston. <br> <br>
	Prior to being the iconographic Sears building, the site was home to the lush gardens of the Walter & Estelle Sharp estate. Walter Sharp started his career with a water well drilling company; which fortuitously allowed him to capitalize upon the discovery of Spindletop Field. Later on he helped found Moonshine Oil, and, subsequently, became president of Producers Oil Company. Most famously, however, he was a large shareholder in Texas Company (later known as Texaco). While Walter Benona Sharp was undoubtedly one of the preeminent Houston figures of the late 19th century,  the legacy of the Sharp Estate is owed entirely to the efforts made by Estelle Sharp. After Walter’s passing in 1912, she focused her work on a myriad of charities. One of the most important being the first endowed lectureship to Rice Institute in 1918. This relationship would only continue to grow with time. Rice acquired the Sharp Estate in 1938, but decided to demolish the house to make way for a suburban Sears, Roebuck and Company Store leased on a contract of 99 years. <br> <br>
The store, designed by Chicago architecture firm Nimmon, Carr, & Wright, reached early critical acclaim, and was profiled among 4 other stores in the September 1940 edition of Architectural Record. As shopping centers designed, “to provide for substantially every need of the customer from air in an auto-mobile tire to a place to lunch after completing purchases”, they were revolutionary to say the least. In addition to its gorgeous art deco fenestration, this Sears building did something else that was soon to become a Houston standard. The introduction, normalization, and proliferation of the parking lot as a human right. While such a parking lot wouldn’t even be worth mentioning for a building of such scale today, Architectural Record was astounded by the ingenuity of Sears-Roebuck. In willingly separating the structures from the downtown districts, Sears made the democratic decision, and submitted to the whims of not only the “potential customer from the city” but “the local customer . . . and the suburban customer” as well. <br> <br>
	Moving from the parking lot to the entrance was planned like a heroic promenade. The scale of the building is broken down by the polished, pink, Texas granite that wraps both the chamfered entrance on the corner of the store and the side facing the service station. The large glass windows are delicately inset into the granite, and highlight the bleeding edge technology of window displays. The building was also famous for its approach to retail architecture. The Sears building was the first building in Houston to utilize the new technology of the escalator. Contemporary designers Srdjian Jovanovic Weiss and Sze Tsung Leong in Project on the City II: The Harvard Guide to Shopping claim, “No invention has had the importance for and impact on shopping as the escalator.” If we accept this claim as fact, then it wouldn't be far fetched to say that the Sears building and its innovations would make it the most important piece of retail architecture (second maybe to the Galleria) in Houston’s history. Later In Weiss and Leong’s seminal text they describe how “the escalator profoundly modifies architecture - it denies the relevance of both compartments and floors.” Indeed, Nimmon, Carr, & Wright would have agreed with this assessment. The escalator in this building was centrally located, and, undoubtedly, blurred the lines between floors and departments.  <br> <br>
	With the passage of time, however, the Sears building quickly fell out of taste. By the late 1950s The international style had consumed the United States, and the Art Deco structures of Houston were regarded as antiquated, but not quite nostalgic. The Melrose Building of 1952 was Houston’s first modern tower. Its sleek design and ease of construction entranced both the general public and, more importantly, the developers of Houston. <br> <br>
This era, however, is where the history of the Sears building begins to get complicated. In a 1962 interview with the Houston chronicle, the store’s general manager began to brag about an upcoming “modernization” that would “completely and radically change” the facade of the store. And radically change it did. The art deco fenestration underwent a process called “slipcovering”. Paul Homeyer, in Cite 63 Spring 2005, defined slipcovered buildings as “Structures that have been sheathed in newer materials that partially or completely mask their original facades, along with their character, composition, detail, and ornament.” In the case of the Sears building, the material decided for the covering was a beige corrugated metal. The renovation entirely reduced the complexity of the building, and rendered it as a one note monstrosity. A Philadelphia Savings Funds Society with none of the vertical interest and a worse sign. <br> <br>
The question all of the blog posts seem to ask is who in their right mind would ever authorize such a horrendous renovation? What I’ve yet to see, however, is questions of how this renovation ties into the greater history of development in Houston, and, subsequently, its relationship to development in minority communities. It is not  a controversial statement to say that the 60s were a tumultuous time for race relations in America. It wouldn’t then be difficult to see how the apathy we are experiencing now would have existed in the 60s as well. Banal subjects like department store renovations could fly under the radar, even if more insidious factors could be read from it. While many claim that the renovation stemmed solely from a desire to “keep up” with public opinion, Barry Moore in his essay “When Good Buildings Go Bad” had a different theory as to what spurred the changes:
In the case of Houston, it was the threat of race riots. In the tumultuous aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr."s assassination in l968, local Black Panther activist Lee Otis Johnson organized an 8,000-person strong memorial march, which unsettled much of the business community. Sears, watching from a Chicago torn apart the same summer, reacted by bricking up almost all the Houston store's show windows and cladding the elegant upper stones with beige metal. And so Fort Sears has remained ever since, hiding from an evolving international city and culture, and wondering where all the shoppers went. <br> <br>
It is in this exact moment that we can begin to trace how the Architecture of the Sears building became a tool through which developers could exact damage upon the minority communities that threatened it. Gone were the pie-crust fenestrations, and here to stay was the unfriendly neighbor. A building that projected misery to all onlooking. <br> <br>
	What resulted from this calculated operation, was a self-fulfilling prophecy not unlike that of Pruitt-Igoe. The outright gloominess projected from the beige metal, invited only negative comments. While the old Sears building made a conscious effort to respond to the human scale, this new iteration seemed to outright reject the human. The building quickly fell into disarray, and as its perception got worse so in turn did the building’s physical appearance. Amber Wiley, in her essay Schools and Prisons, draws a salient point on aesthetics when she says, “The prison-like aspects of the design were mainly attributed to the hard, brutalist exterior that was experienced from the outside. The image of the school as a prison derived from the building’s materiality, its massive shapes, and its lack of windows” This point is only amplified when considered against Michael Foucault’s question from Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, “Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?” While it would be foolish to say Sears was purposefully driving their customers away through weaponized architecture, it is not a stretch to assume that vested interests wanted to both drive the prices of midtown land down and exact control over the minority communities that lived there. <br> <br>
	In January of 2018, the Sears closed its doors after 79 years of business. Today the site is famous for having been one of the largest homeless encampments in Houston, and a flurry of construction as the Rice Endowment Fund begins upon its new master plan. The Rice Endowment Fund as a result of low land prices, has been able to accumulate a large holding in the area. In addition to buying Sears out of the 20 remaining years on their lease, they have positioned themselves for a premier return on investments for the startup incubator they’re shoving inside the newly renovated, corporate building.
